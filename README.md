# WarperPerspective

This project makes a nice little wrapper for a GUI used to calibrate OpenCV's warpPerspective function in Python. It provides a GUI that the user can click the top left, top right, bottom right and bottom left corners to produce a Warper object that can used later to warp images from sources such as a webcam.
